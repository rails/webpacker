# Webpacker as an official Rails gem has been retired ðŸŒ…

Webpacker has served the Rails community for over five years as a bridge to compiled and bundled JavaScript. This bridge is no longer needed for most people in most situations following [the release of Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision). We now have [three great default answers to JavaScript in 2021+](https://world.hey.com/dhh/rails-7-will-have-three-great-answers-to-javascript-in-2021-8d68191b), and thus we will no longer be evolving Webpacker in an official Rails capacity.

First, for applications currently using Webpacker, check the [jsbundling-rails comparison with webpacker](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails/blob/main/docs/comparison_with_webpacker.md) to see if you need advanced webpack integration. If you can do without advanced webpack features, especially hot module reloading and code-splitting, consider switching to [jsbundling-rails with Webpack](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails/) (or another bundler). The [switching guide](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails/blob/main/docs/switch_from_webpacker.md) explains this conversion. Alternatively, you may want to try making the jump all the way to [import maps](https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails/). That's the default setup for new Rails 7 applications, but depending on your JavaScript use, it may be a substantial jump.

As mentioned, the Rails core team will not be releasing a v6 of Webpacker. However, Justin Gordon is continuing that line of development under a new gem called [Shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker) that is based on the unreleased v6 work from this repository. Thus, if you need advanced wepbpack integration, you should migrate to Shakapacker v6+. The transition is easy, as all internal names are still `webpacker`.

Or you can continue to use Webpacker as-is. We will continue to address security issues on the Ruby side of the gem according to [the normal maintenance schedule of Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html#security-issues). This pertains to the v5 edition of this gem that was included by default with previous versions of Rails. However, Webpacker v5 is based on older versions of webpack and Babel, so consider upgrading one way or another.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to Webpacker over the last five-plus years!

_Please refer to the [5-x-stable](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/tree/5-x-stable) branch for 5.x documentation._
