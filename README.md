# Webpacker

Webpacker makes it easy to use the JavaScript preprocessor and bundler [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)
to manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset pipeline,
as the purpose is only to use Webpack for app-like JavaScript, not images, css, or
even JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets).

It's designed to work with Rails 5.1+ and makes use of the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) dependency management
that's been made default from that version forward.

## Installation

Webpacker is currently compatible with Rails 5.0 stable, but there's no guarantee it will still be
in the future.

You can either make use of Webpacker during setup of a new application with `--webpack`
or you can add the gem and run `bin/rails webpacker:install` in an existing application.

As the rubygems version isn't promised to be kept up to date until the release of Rails 5.1, you may want to include the gem directly from GitHub:

```ruby
gem 'webpacker', github: 'rails/webpacker'
```

## Binstubs

Webpacker ships with three binstubs: `./bin/webpack`, `./bin/webpack-watcher` and `./bin/webpack-dev-server`.
They're thin wrappers around the standard webpack.js executable, just to ensure that the right configuration
file is loaded and the node_modules from vendor are used.

In development, you'll need to run `./bin/webpack-watcher` in a separate terminal from
`./bin/rails server` to have your `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files compiled as you make changes.
If you'd rather not have to run the two processes separately by hand, you can use
[Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/).

Alternatively, you can run `./bin/webpack-dev-server`. This will launch a
[Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) listening on http://localhost:8080/
serving your pack files. It will recompile your files as you make changes. You also need to set
`config.x.webpacker[:dev_server_host]` in your `config/environment/development.rb` to tell Webpacker to load
your packs from the Webpack Dev Server. This setup allows you to leverage advanced Webpack features, such
as [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html).


## Configuration

Webpacker gives you a default set of configuration files for development and production. They
all live together with the shared points in `config/webpack/*.js`. By default, you shouldn't have to
make any changes for a basic setup out the box. But this is where you do go if you need something
more advanced.

The configuration for what Webpack is supposed to compile by default rests on the convention that
every file in `app/javascript/packs/*` should be turned into their own output files (or entry points,
as Webpack calls it).

Let's say you're building a calendar. Your structure could look like this:

```erb
<%# app/views/layout/application.html.erb %>
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'calendar' %>
```

```js
// app/javascript/packs/calendar.js
require('calendar')
```

```
app/javascript/calendar/index.js // gets loaded by require('calendar')
app/javascript/calendar/components/grid.jsx
app/javascript/calendar/models/month.js
```

But it could also look a million other ways. The only convention that Webpacker enforces is the
one where entry points are automatically configured by the files in `app/javascript/packs`.


## Deployment

To compile all the packs during deployment, you can use the `rails webpacker:compile` command. This
will invoke the production configuration, which includes digesting. The `javascript_pack_tag` helper
method will automatically insert the correct digest when run in production mode. Just like the asset
pipeline does it.

## Linking to sprockets assets

It's possible to link to assets that have been precompiled by sprockets. Add the `.erb` extension 
to your javascript file, then you can use Sprockets' asset helpers:

``` 
// app/javascript/my_pack/example.js.erb

<% helpers = ActionController::Base.helpers %>
var railsImagePath = "<%= helpers.image_path('rails.png') %>";
```

This is enabled by the `rails-erb-loader` loader rule in `config/webpack/shared.js`. 

## Ready for React

To use Webpacker with React, just create a new app with `rails new myapp --webpack=react` (or run `rails webpacker:install:react` on a Rails 5.1 app already setup with webpack), and all the relevant dependencies
will be added via yarn and changes to the configuration files made. Now you can create JSX files and
have them properly compiled automatically.


## Work left to do

- Improve process for linking to assets compiled by sprockets - shouldn't need to specify
` <% helpers = ActionController::Base.helpers %>` at the beginning of each file
- Consider chunking setup
- Consider on-demand compiling with digests when digesting=true
- I'm sure a ton of other shit
