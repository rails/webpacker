### Fixed
- Update `.babelrc` to fix compilation issues - [#306](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/306)

- Duplicated asset hosts - [#320](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/320), [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

- Missing asset host when defined as a `Proc` or on `ActionController::Base.asset_host` directly - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

- Incorrect asset host when running `webpacker:compile` or `bin/webpack` in development mode - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

### Added
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) support. You can now add Elm support via the following methods:
  - New app: `rails new <app> --webpack=elm`
  - Within an existing app: `rails webpacker:install:elm`

- Support for custom `public_output_path` paths independent of `source_entry_path` in `config/webpacker.yml`. `output` is also now relative to `public/`. - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

    Before (compile to `public/packs`):
    ```yaml
      source_entry_path: packs
      public_output_path: packs
    ```
    After (compile to `public/sweet/js`):
    ```yaml
      source_entry_path: packs
      public_output_path: sweet/js
    ```
- Consolidate `paths.yml` and `development.server.yml` into one file - `config/webpacker.yml` - [#403](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/403)
