## [2.0] - 2017-05-24


### Fixed
- Update `.babelrc` to fix compilation issues - [#306](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/306)

- Duplicated asset hosts - [#320](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/320), [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

- Missing asset host when defined as a `Proc` or on `ActionController::Base.asset_host` directly - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

- Incorrect asset host when running `webpacker:compile` or `bin/webpack` in development mode - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

- Update `webpacker:compile` task to use `stdout` and `stderr` for better logging - [#395](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/395)

- ARGV support for `webpack-dev-server` - [#286](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/286)


### Added
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) support. You can now add Elm support via the following methods:
  - New app: `rails new <app> --webpack=elm`
  - Within an existing app: `rails webpacker:install:elm`

- Support for custom `public_output_path` paths independent of `source_entry_path` in `config/webpacker.yml`. `output` is also now relative to `public/`. - [#397](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/397)

    Before (compile to `public/packs`):
    ```yaml
      source_entry_path: packs
      public_output_path: packs
    ```
    After (compile to `public/sweet/js`):
    ```yaml
      source_entry_path: packs
      public_output_path: sweet/js
    ```

- `https` option to use `https` mode, particularly on platforms like - https://community.c9.io/t/running-a-rails-app/1615 or locally - [#176](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/176)

- [Babel] Dynamic import() and Class Fields and Static Properties babel plugin to `.babelrc`

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "modules": false,
      "targets": {
        "browsers": "> 1%",
        "uglify": true
      },
      "useBuiltIns": true
    }]
  ],

  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import",
    "transform-class-properties", { "spec": true }
  ]
}
```

- Source-map support for production bundle


#### Breaking Change

- Consolidate and flatten `paths.yml` and `development.server.yml` config into one file - `config/webpacker.yml` - [#403](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/pull/403). This is a breaking change and requires you to re-install webpacker and cleanup old configuration files.

  ```bash
  bundle update webpacker
  bundle exec rails webpacker:install

  # Remove old/unused configuration files
  rm config/webpack/paths.yml
  rm config/webpack/development.server.yml
  rm config/webpack/development.server.js
  ```


## [1.2] - 2017-04-27

```
bundle update webpacker
bundle exec rails webpacker:install
```
